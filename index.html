            <div class="syl-text">
                <p>This workshop is a practical introduction to building websites, covering the technical basics of HTML and CSS, with a quick foray into JavaScript and programming concepts in Week Four. Skills learned each week are practiced in one-off assignments and contextualized within a larger personal project built over the course of the workshop. This larger project is intended to serve as a springboard for future coding endeavors.</p>

                <p>By the successful completion of this workshop, students will have:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Working knowledge of HTML and CSS syntax</li>
                    <li>An understanding of the differences between and uses of HTML/CSS & JavaScript in the browser</li>
                    <li>Awareness of the structure of web pages and how it affects design decisions</li>
                    <li>Increased ability to find answers online to coding problems</li>
                    <li>And hopefully, excitement for the possibilities of code as a medium, and the desire to continue study.</li>

                <p>Lectures will largely be technical in nature, with the goal of introducing students to the terminologies and affordances of the code concepts relevant for upcoming assignments.</p>

                <p>There are 7 assignments total in this workshop. Assignments will be a combination of prescriptive coding exercises, looser design applications, and straight up online lessons. Assignment 07 is a larger personal project that will be developed over the course of the workshop and serves as the "final."</p>

                <p>Some assignments (or parts of assignments) are optional. Assignments that are entirely optional are grayed out in the schedule, while assignments that are partially optional will have those parts grayed out under the assignment description.</p>

                <p>Please arrive on time and prepared for each class. One unexcused absence will result in failure of the course. I value clear communication regarding any circumstances that require an absence or an extension, as early as possible.</p>

                <p>Due to the technical nature of this workshop and the (somewhat) steep learning curve, grading of assignments will rely on demonstrated effort rather than final polish. "Effort" will be understood through risktaking in non-prescriptive assignments and documentation (via comments) of code that was attempted but did not work.</p>
    
                <p>Aside from assignments, grading will consider the contribution of comments in Slack on fellow students' work, or of references and inspiration to the <i>#_references</i> channel.</p>

                <p>A classroom is a space for learning through a process of thoughtful and generous engagement with the course material and with the classroom community. As members of this classroom community, we are all responsible for actively contributing to and supporting a learning environment built on honest and respectful dialogue and attentive listening. While it is inevitable that there will be moments of disagreement–perhaps even offense–in the classroom, we can learn from these moments by agreeing to discuss and address them collectively. Learning how to defend your opinions and debate in a reasoned way is crucial to your growth at RISD and beyond… Please read the rest of the RISD classroom statement <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Qj80-Q4Q_5q_dzMCViEtTc24tg2T09TH/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>

                <p>Create a single-page website using your choice of content. This project should demonstrate a cumulation of the skills we've learned in this workshop.</p>
                <p>This assignment can be treated as the start of a larger web project, or it can exist on its own. The important thing is that you feel invested in its outcome. We will be working on this assignment over the course of the workshop, and a recommended week-to-week workflow is specified in the schedule.</p>
                <p>If you are having trouble deciding on a project idea, you could follow this prompt:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pick an expressive piece of text, whether it's song lyrics, a poem, a manifesto, etc. Combine this text with imagery. Consider how web technologies can be an expressive platform for text with affordances beyond the printed page.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="due">Due 1 week after the last class meeting.</p>
